## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#6A43BA) to give a sophisticated impression. Violet inspires reflection and self-examination, suitable to a project about getting an approximate evaluation.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#21232A). Almost the same hue as the primary color, and a good color for reading long blocks of text.
- Accent color: Indigo (#4B0082), slightly more saturated and significantly darker than the primary, for highlights.
- Use a modern, sans-serif font to ensure readability and a sleek aesthetic.
- Minimalist icons for the 'How It Works' section to guide users through the process.
- Ensure fully responsive design for optimal viewing experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Implement subtle micro-animations for hover effects and animated transitions on the main elements.
